            <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Who is kollektiv orangotango?</h2>
            <p>kollektiv orangotango was founded in 2008. Since then it has been constantly developing 
                through a network of critical geographers, friends and activists who deal with questions 
                regarding space, power and re­sistance. With our geographical activism, we seek to support 
                processes and oppositional actors who instigate social change by prefiguring social 
                alternatives. We conduct emancipatory educational work as well as con­crete political and 
                artistic interventions. These are supposed to enforce reflections on and changes of social 
                conditions. Through workshops, publications, mappings, excursions, and creative in­terventions 
                within public space, we collectively learn how to read space and how to initiate emancipatory 
                processes from below. By sticking to the traditions of activist research, we connect 
                theoret­ical reflections and concrete actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far we have engaged in the fields of right to the city, (urban) agriculture, critical 
                pedagogy, alternative housing and solidarity economy, mostly in Europe and also in Latin 
                America. But kollektiv orangotango also functions as a platform for dif­ferent actions. 
                In the case of Not-an-Atlas, its publication was realized by kollektiv orangotango in 
                cooperation with other activists and academics. That is the reason why it was named 
                kollektiv orangotango+.
            </p>
            <p>All of this is happen­ing through collective and self-organized practice. In other words: 
                “We’re going slow, because we’re going far”!

            <h2>How to Edit and Reflect Counter-Cartographies Collectively as Activists and Academics?</h2>
            <p>Both our activist experiences with collective and critical mapping workshops as kollektiv
                 orangotango as well as our individual and academic engagements with maps served as 
                 starting points for Not-an-Atlas. In the spring of 2015 we released a <a href="#0">Call for Maps 
                 in English, German and Spanish</a>, inviting everyone engaged with practices of critical 
                 mapping to send us ideas, texts, photos and, of course, maps. We were overwhelmed by
                  the resonance! Nearly 150 submissions found their way to us. Some of them came from 
                  places, struggles and activists we had not heard of before; oth­ers came from 
                  long-time companions and friends. Among them were contributions from well-known 
                  critical cartographers, ac­tivists, and social movements who have been working with 
                  maps for many years; but even more emerging mapmakers sent us their proposals. 
                  What followed were exciting three years of discussing, selecting and editing the 
                  various maps and projects. Again and again we had to ask ourselves: What actually 
                  makes a map (not) critical? And what do we (not) have in mind when working on a 
                  counter-atlas? We also had to continually negotiate between more activist and more 
                  academic modes of knowledge production – be it in regards to the content of the 
                  maps or in regards to our own mode of working and living. With the large number 
                  of submis­sions, Not-an-Atlas quickly outgrew its initial frame in terms of involved 
                  languages, time and resources. The resulting process of collective learning therefore 
                  included various challenges, personal fluctuations and surprises. There we started 
                  to think about an online version of Not-an-Atlas. So we understand <a href="#0">notanatlas.org</a> as 
                  a continuation of the Not-an-Atlas book. Because we want to continue to share maps, 
                  struggles, projects, texts and inspirations online.
