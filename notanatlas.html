        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Who is kollektiv orangotango?</h2>
        <p>kollektiv orangotango was founded in 2008. Since then it has been constantly developing 
            through a network of critical geographers, friends and activists who deal with questions 
            regarding space, power and re­sistance. With our geographical activism, we seek to support 
            processes and oppositional actors who instigate social change by prefiguring social 
            alternatives. We conduct emancipatory educational work as well as con­crete political and 
            artistic interventions. These are supposed to enforce reflections on and changes of social 
            conditions. Through workshops, publications, mappings, excursions, and creative in­terventions 
            within public space, we collectively learn how to read space and how to initiate emancipatory 
            processes from below. By sticking to the traditions of activist research, we connect 
            theoret­ical reflections and concrete actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far we have engaged in the fields of right to the city, (urban) agriculture, critical 
            pedagogy, alternative housing and solidarity economy, mostly in Europe and also in Latin 
            America. But kollektiv orangotango also functions as a platform for dif­ferent actions. 
            In the case of Not-an-Atlas, its publication was realized by kollektiv orangotango in 
            cooperation with other activists and academics. That is the reason why it was named 
            kollektiv orangotango+.
        </p>
        <p>All of this is happen­ing through collective and self-organized practice. In other words: 
            “We’re going slow, because we’re going far”!
